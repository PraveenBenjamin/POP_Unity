Commentary during development :- 13/09/2019, punched in at 8:00 am
9:27) Started out by adding overarching framework classes and setting up a skeleton architecture
10:34) adding/ removing and modifying said classes as the project progresses
12:38) Since im the only programmer im not really focused on logically seperating the development into git branches. 
12:38) It feels wonderful to be programming again :D
12:58) BTW, im writing everything from scratch, despite me having plenty of previously done work to draw from, so
that you guys can get a better feel for how i work and how long i take
2:20) Lunch
2:24) back at it, dealing with basetransition atm
4:21) Added the framework components for most of the menus, building the flow from the splashscreen->Mainmenu->LevelSelect->Gameplay
will begin writing gameplay next
5:51) started gameplay architecture about 20 mins back. Calculating positions of actors on the grid now.
7:05) almost done with the base architecture of the game, will be finalizing the flow before EOD
7:37) EOD, completed the basic architecture and overall flow of the game, tomorrow will be debugging the architecture and completing implementation sans UI
